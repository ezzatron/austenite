## Unreleased

### Added

- Added a `Declaration<T>` type that can be used to explicitly type
  declarations.

### Fixed

- Enumeration declarations can now infer the value type when the `members`
  argument is passed as an object without needing to use `as const`.

## [v0.12.0] - 2024-11-08

[v0.12.0]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.12.0

### Changed

- **\[BREAKING\]** In order to trigger Markdown usage generation, you must now
  use `AUSTENITE_MODE=usage/markdown` instead of `AUSTENITE_SPEC=true`. This
  allows for new modes to be added in the future without breaking existing
  behavior, and more closely matches the behavior of Ferrite.

## [v0.11.1] - 2024-11-06

[v0.11.1]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.11.1

### Fixed

- Markdown spec generation code is now imported conditionally, so that build
  tools can potentially exclude spec generation support from the final bundle
  when it's not needed.

## [v0.11.0] - 2024-11-05

[v0.11.0]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.11.0

### Changed

- **\[BREAKING\]** The `initialize()` function has moved to the `austenite/node`
  sub-path export. You can now import it from `austenite/node` instead of
  `austenite`.

### Fixed

- This library now works better with Next.js. Previously Next.js would complain
  about various imports that were incompatible with the Edge Runtime. This has
  been improved in two ways:
  - The `initialize()` function, which uses some Node.js APIs, has been moved to
    the `austenite/node` sub-path export. Importing declaration functions from
    the main `austenite` module will no longer cause these Node.js APIs to be
    included in the Next.js server bundle.
  - Any remaining Node.js API imports have been updated to use the `node:`
    protocol, which allows Next.js to provide Edge Runtime polyfills. An example
    of this is the use of the `buffer` module, which is essential for `binary()`
    declarations, and can only be polyfilled by Next.js when imported as
    `node:buffer`.
- Fixed incorrect CommonJS type definitions.

## [v0.10.1] - 2024-03-30

[v0.10.1]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.10.1

### Fixed

- Removed unused `mdast` dependency.

## [v0.10.0] - 2024-03-30

[v0.10.0]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.10.0

### Added

- Custom constraints can now be defined for all declarations.

### Changed

- **\[BREAKING\]** The `initialize()` function is now `async`.
- If you have [Prettier] installed in your project, Austenite will now use it to
  format generated Markdown specification output.
- The generated specification output has been improved.
- Markdown phrasing content is now supported in variable and constraint
  descriptions.

## [v0.9.1] - 2024-03-25

[v0.9.1]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.9.1

### Fixed

- Replaced usage of `node:` imports to avoid issues when Austenite is included
  in a Webpack server bundle.

## [v0.9.0] - 2024-03-24

[v0.9.0]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.9.0

### Added

- Example values can now be overridden in any declaration.

### Changed

- **\[BREAKING\]** Explicit examples must be provided in a declaration if the
  declaration uses constraints that would make the auto-generated examples
  invalid.

## [v0.8.0] - 2024-03-23

[v0.8.0]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.8.0

### Added

- Declarations can now be marked as sensitive, which will cause their default
  values and actual values to be redacted in validation summaries, generated
  specifications, and exception messages.
- Length constraints can now be set on `binary` and `string` variable
  declarations.
- Range constraints can now be set on `number`, `integer`, `bigInteger`,
  `networkPortNumber`, and `duration` variable declarations.

### Changed

- The generated specification output has been improved to be easier to read.
- The validation summary output uses "not set" instead of "undefined" to
  describe values that are not set, or are set to empty values.

## [v0.7.0] - 2024-03-15

[v0.7.0]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.7.0

### Added

- Added `binary` variable declarations.

## [v0.6.2] - 2023-10-15

[v0.6.2]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.6.2

### Fixed

- Fixed badge images and links in the README.

## [v0.6.1] - 2023-10-15

[v0.6.1]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.6.1

### Fixed

- Fixed CJS TypeScript build.

## [v0.6.0] - 2023-10-15

[v0.6.0]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.6.0

### Changed

- Renamed the NPM package from `@eloquent/austenite` to `austenite`.

## [v0.5.0] - 2022-12-30

[v0.5.0]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.5.0

### Added

- Added `networkPortNumber` declarations.

## [v0.4.0] - 2022-10-29

[v0.4.0]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.4.0

### Changed

- Declarations made after `initalize()` is called will no longer cause an
  exception to be thrown. It is up to the end user to ensure all declarations
  are made before `initalize()` is called.
- Declaration values can now be accessed before `initialize()` is called without
  an exception being thrown.

These changes are designed to facilitate cases where declarations are made
multiple times in different execution contexts (e.g. both outside and inside
"bundled" code).

## [v0.3.0] - 2022-10-26

[v0.3.0]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.3.0

### Added

- The app name can now be set explicitly with the `AUSTENITE_APP` environment
  variable.

## [v0.2.5] - 2022-10-26

[v0.2.5]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.2.5

### Fixed

- Fixed pre-publish `package.json` script.

## [v0.2.4] - 2022-10-26

[v0.2.4]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.2.4

### Changed

- The package should now actually support CommonJS.
- Removed dependency on all `mdast` packages.
- Removed dependency on `ip-regex` package, as it is ESM-only.
- Added dependency on `ipaddr.js` package, as it supports CJS.

## [v0.2.3] - 2022-10-25

[v0.2.3]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.2.3

### Fixed

- Removed dependency on renamed `mdast` package.

## [v0.2.2] - 2022-10-25

[v0.2.2]: https://github.com/ezzatron/austenite/releases/tag/v0.2.2

### Fixed

- Made CommonJS module actually load as CommonJS. It's unlikely to help, because
  some dependencies are ESM-only.
